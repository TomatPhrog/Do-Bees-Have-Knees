## Exoskeletons

Bees are insects that have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton" target="_blank">exoskeletons</a>. Most insects got exoskeletons. Instead of having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone" target="_blank">bones</a> inside of their body they have their bones on the outside like sick little freaks. Fortunately bumblebees at least have the decency to cover themselves in a jacket of fluffy fur.

Due to the fact they have exoskeletons, knees would be a bit complicated. Knees are made of a combination of cartilage, tendons and bones. With all their bone on the outside where is the space for cartilage and tendons?

Well, bees have some of the sames bones humans have. They have both a femur and tibia. The femur points up while the tibia and remaining segments point downwards. These two join together to make a <a href="https://youtu.be/uBUq1hmbtPE?si=gC_SAK9AcNE9-Ooj&t=173" target="_blank">knee</a>.
