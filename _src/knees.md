## The Bees Knees

Human beings have hones and muscles which help us move. Without bones we'd be a floppy pile of meat and without meat we'd be bare skeletons which is indecent and should be covered up.

Like bees we have a femur bone in our thigh and a tibia bone in our shin. These bones come together to form a knee.
