            <h2>Exoskeletons</h2>
<p>Bees are insects that have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton" target="_blank">exoskeletons</a>. Most insects got exoskeletons. Instead of having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone" target="_blank">bones</a> inside of their body they have their bones on the outside like sick little freaks. Fortunately bumblebees at least have the decency to cover themselves in a jacket of fluffy fur.</p>
<p><img src="/images/beesHaveClothes.webp" alt="A bumblebbe and an ant are being compare with eachother. The bee is describes as having clothes while the ant is getting called naked."></p>
<p>Due to the fact they have exoskeletons, knees would be a bit complicated. Knees are made of a combination of cartilage, tendons and bones. With all their bone on the outside where is the space for cartilage and tendons?</p>
<p>Well, bees have some of the sames bones humans have. They have both a femur and tibia. The femur points up while the tibia and remaining segments point downwards. These two join together to make a <a href="https://youtu.be/uBUq1hmbtPE?si=gC_SAK9AcNE9-Ooj&t=173" target="_blank">knee</a>.</p>
